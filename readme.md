## a no frills website ##

This is a project I've been procrastinating on for two years now, but I think I'm going to finally get it together. It's so easy to let the majority of our content exist on sites like Facebook, but we can forget from time to time that they are a sort of dark-web, only allowing access to members of the sites.

This is something different. Not a blog, more like a repository of information....but not a wiki either. Let's see how it goes.

Built (poorly) with Poole.
