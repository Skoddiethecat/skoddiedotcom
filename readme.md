## a central repository for all things Skoddie ##

This is a project I've been procrastinating on for two years now, but it's finally come together. It's so easy to let the majority of our content exist on sites like Facebook, but we can forget from time to time that they are a sort of dark-web, only allowing access to members of the sites.

This is something different. Not a blog, more like a repository of information....but not a wiki either. Let's see how it goes.

Built (poorly) with Poole.
