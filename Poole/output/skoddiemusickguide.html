<h3>Conscious Separation*</h3>
<p><img alt="Conscious Separation" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/ConsciousSeparation.png" title="Conscious Separation" /></p>
<p>My return to music after a 6-year hiatus caused by a mental break. Focused on ambiguity, and designed to let the listener ascribe their own meaning to it.</p>
<h3>Biaxially-Oriented Polyethylene Terephthalate*</h3>
<p><img alt="Biaxially-Oriented Polyethylene Terephthalate" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/Biaxially-OrientedPolyethyleneTerephthalate.png" title="Biaxially-Oriented Polyethylene Terephthalate" /></p>
<p>A VHS Concept album that I began on my birthday in 2015. It grew out of my excitement towards Vaporwave combined with my fear of producing more conventional music</p>
<h3>χmas Album*</h3>
<p><img alt="χmas Album" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/XmasAlbum.png" title="χmas Album" /></p>
<p>A "joke" album I created in less than an hour. It was created by manipulating samples of my least favorite christmas music, and I had hoped to capture the sense of isolation and despair that christmas often represents to me.</p>
<h3>Katzenmusick</h3>
<p><img alt="Katzenmusick" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/Katzenmusick.png" title="Katzenmusick" /></p>
<p>This is a live album, and the fruits of my desire to perform a show on Twitch. The music was entirely improvised using piano, synthesizer, computer effects, and on one track I tried to sing.</p>
<h3>Generations</h3>
<p><img alt="Generations" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/Generations.png" title="Generations" /></p>
<p>The results of my experiments with Reaktor 6.0. Each track is a different <em>generative</em> patch, which means that once loaded they will continue to play themselves in a semi-random fashion. In theory each patch can perform itself indefinitely. For a time I had expected that this would be the first in a series of generative works made with Reaktor, however my style evolved more towards drone music and I didn't feel right putting the <em>generative</em> moniker on them.</p>
<h3>協議離婚</h3>
<h4><em>(Kyogi Rikon)</em></h4>
<p><img alt="Kyogi Rikon" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/KyogiRikon.png" title="協議離婚" /></p>
<p>The title is a complex translation/interpretation of the phrase "Irreconcilable Differences" into Japanese. This is my quintessential Vaportrap/Vaporwave album. Taking over 11 months to produce, this was the realization of my ability to produce music within a more-conventional form, and do it quite well. Part of me had hoped that this album would get me some larger level of notoriety. Conceptually, this album explores a lot of my childhood, and the samples used frequently call back to specific experiences in my life.</p>
<h3>On Saturday, After School</h3>
<p><img alt="On Saturday, After School" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/OnSaturdayAfterSchool.png" title="On Saturday, After School" /></p>
<p>This album was the combination of my desire to make an album in a similar style to Nmesh, a tribute to the shows I used to watch while growing up, and my usual habit of making a ton of music on three day weekends. The entire record was created during a Twitch livestream, though on day 2 I got a little 'tryhard face'. This is a very 'traditional' vaporwave album, and doesn't feature quite the level of sample manipulation I've become known for, but it succeeds at communicating the dreamstate of my childhood. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> the original title of this album was <em>Saturday Morning, After School</em>, but I mistyped it when creating the cover art and didn't want to go back and redo it.</p>
<h3>(Pi)ano Phase</h3>
<p><img alt="(Pi)ano Phase" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/(Pi)anoPhase.png" title="(Pi)ano Phase" /></p>
<p>This is my performance of Piano Phase by Steve Reich, which was inspired by an tutorial example that ships with Sonic Pi. I expanded on the example by adjusting the tempo and phase, doing a little sound design, and adding a polymetric bass line and bell accent. I also programmed in the third melody of the piece at the end. I may go back and revise it at some point to include all three melodies. This entire piece started as a Sonic Pi practice session, but I was so pleased with my work that I decided to release it.</p>
<h3>Eight Twelve</h3>
<p><img alt="Eight Twelve" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/EightTwelve.png" title="EightTwelve" /></p>
<p>An experiment in making some fairly intense breakcore in 7/7 and 11/11. While many may say those time signatures do not exist, I was trying to capture a rhythmic feel that didn’t sound like it was compounded. I’m not sure I succeeded in this, as much of it has something of a free time feel to it.</p>
<h3>{6c4e311a​-​bfb2​-​4da4​-​89d7​-​2ce49e566eaa}</h3>
<p><img alt="{6c4e311a​-​bfb2​-​4da4​-​89d7​-​2ce49e566eaa}" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/{6c4e311a​-​bfb2​-​4da4​-​89d7​-​2ce49e566eaa}.png" title="{6c4e311a​-​bfb2​-​4da4​-​89d7​-​2ce49e566eaa}" /></p>
<p>A surprisingly successful experiment in making a piece of drone music that could be run for hours without boring the listener. While this release is slightly over 2 hours, the patch could run for days without technically repeating itself.</p>
<h3>ベンディー・ｾｯｸｽ・ホゥイッスル</h3>
<p><img alt="Bendi Sekkusu Ho-uissuru" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/BendiSekkusuHo-uissuru.png" title="ベンディー・ｾｯｸｽ・ホゥイッスル" /></p>
<p>A saxy lo-fi vaporwave split with ＮｕＲｅａｌｉｔｙ. This began life as a series of tracks for a split with //◭// ｈｄ ｎｅｔｓｃａｐｅ //◭// in the summer of 2017, and after sitting on the shelf for a few months ＮｕＲｅａｌｉｔｙ stepped in to complete it.</p>
<h3>{bde69c8a​-​382e​-​4dc8​-​8a2d​-​2162faae4ffa}</h3>
<p><img alt="{bde69c8a​-​382e​-​4dc8​-​8a2d​-​2162faae4ffa}" src="C:/Users/skraemer/Documents/GitHub/skoddiedotcom/Poole/output/img/coverart/{bde69c8a​-​382e​-​4dc8​-​8a2d​-​2162faae4ffa}.png" title="{bde69c8a​-​382e​-​4dc8​-​8a2d​-​2162faae4ffa}" /></p>
<p>My first release using my Eurorack modular synthesizer. I tried to create a patch which used everything that <em>could</em> be an oscillator as an oscillator. After some positive feedback from friends in a Facebook group, I decided to record and release it.</p>
<p><em>*These albums are stylistically linked, and were all produced with essentially the same technique of layering heavily manipulated samples of commercial music.</em></p></div>
