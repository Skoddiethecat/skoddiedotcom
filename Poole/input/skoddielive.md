            A neat performance for a modular showcase at Noisebug in Pomona, CA. I was *extremely* pleased with how everything came off, and the set was strong enough that folks were walking in off the street to listen.

            An online performance for the Left Coast Modular Synth Community, and the public debut of my General CV module. There were a few muck-ups during the set, but the overall effect is STRONG.

            An interesting set consisting of a single note played for 45 minutes. Strangely, this was a Sunday show in a DTLA tavern. Good venue, good crowd, good people, one note.
