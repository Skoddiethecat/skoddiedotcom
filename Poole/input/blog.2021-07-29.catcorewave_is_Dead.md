[catcorewave](https://skoddie.com/catcorewave.html) is dead.

I end-of-life'd it earlier this year after it was clear that I was unsuccessful in my goal of creating regular & digestable audio content that was decidedly *not* a podcast. Over the course of production, it became clear that the trappings of podcasts were unavoidable due to the simple nature of the culture around them, so the audio zine necessarily came to an end.

I've uploaded every issue to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/catcorewave-audio-zine) so that you can hear what once was.

Thank you to everybody for the support, I'm only sorry that this experiment was unsuccessful.{{ cursor() }}
