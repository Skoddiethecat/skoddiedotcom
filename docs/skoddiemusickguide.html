            A "joke" album I created in less than an hour. It was created by manipulating samples of my least favorite christmas music, and I had hoped to capture the sense of isolation and despair that christmas often represents to me. As the years have gone by this album has gained popularity, and even I am surprised with the depth of the statement it makes.

            The results of my experiments with Reaktor 6.0. Each track is a different </em>generative<em> patch, which means that once loaded they will continue to play themselves in a semi-random fashion. In theory each patch can perform itself indefinitely. For a time I had expected that this would be the first in a series of generative works made with Reaktor, however my style evolved more towards drone music and I didn't feel right putting the </em>generative<em> moniker on them.

            The title is a complex translation/interpretation of the phrase "Irreconcilable Differences" into Japanese. This is my quintessential Vaportrap/Vaporwave album. Taking over 11 months to produce, this was the realization of my ability to produce music within a more-conventional form, and do it quite well. Part of me had hoped that this album would get me some larger level of notoriety. Conceptually, this album explores a lot of my childhood, and the samples used frequently call back to specific experiences in my life.

            This album was the combination of my desire to make an album in a similar style to Nmesh, a tribute to the shows I used to watch while growing up, and my usual habit of making a ton of music on three day weekends. The entire record was created during a Twitch livestream, though on day 2 I got a little 'tryhard face'. This is a very 'traditional' vaporwave album, and doesn't feature quite the level of sample manipulation I've become known for, but it succeeds at communicating the dreamstate of my childhood. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> the original title of this album was </em>Saturday Morning, After School<em>, but I mistyped it when creating the cover art and didn't want to go back and redo it.

            This is my performance of Piano Phase by Steve Reich, which was inspired by an tutorial example that ships with Sonic Pi. I expanded on the example by adjusting the tempo and phase, doing a little sound design, and adding a polymetric bass line and bell accent. I also programmed in the third melody of the piece at the end. I may go back and revise it at some point to include all three melodies. This entire piece started as a Sonic Pi practice session, but I was so pleased with my work that I decided to release it.

            An experiment in making some fairly intense breakcore in 7/7 and 11/11. While many may say those time signatures do not exist, I was trying to capture a rhythmic feel that didn’t sound like it was compounded. I’m not sure I succeeded in this, as much of it has something of a free time feel to it.

            This album is the result of my experiments in using ByteBeats to modulate sine waves. It covers four equations I was particularly fond of, and is presented at two sample rates. While the tracks sound similar at different sample rates, the carrier frequencies of the sine waves stay the same which creates interesting variations. The equations were also used to generate the cover art, not including the lettering. The actual data used for the cover is identical to the 48k presentation, just interpreted as 8-bit greyscale pixels instead of 8-bit audio samples.

            Technically Inaccurate began life as a collaboration piece with Glenn Sogge. I created a Reaktor patch which he was going to use to create a new piece, and I was going to do the same with a patch he created. Unfortunately my patch ended up being too intense for his machine, so he ended up running my audio through a new patch instead. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I was happy with the output of our collaboration, but I also felt that the output of my patch was strong as it's own piece. I went back in and made further tweaks to help it function in long form, resulting in this album. 
            <br />
            <br />
            This meandering piece is generated by a massive digital logic tree being triggered randomly, feeding back into burst generators, both of which control a series of audio gates as well as over 12 modulators. Beginning at the 30 minute mark, the piece is further processed by additional stacked delay circuits which culminate in a cacophonous mess before abruptly halting.
